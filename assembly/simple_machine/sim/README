This directory contains the basic files necessary to create
the Simple Machine simulator. It includes the following:

- this README
- a Makefile to make sim, the simple machine simulator. Use make install to
    make the simulator. It installs the simulator in this directory.
- the source files sim.c and simulate.c and header files inst.h and sim.h
- the tests directory with simple sim files
- the doc directory with the SimpleMachine documents

All is freely distributed and copied, so long as the copyright restrictions
in the source files are honored. 

Enjoy!
