#
# this program adds four unsigned integers
# since addition is commutative, we can take
# a simple shortcut: e.g.,
#      accum = accum + memory
# is the same as 
#      accum = memory + accum
#
0x100a	# (0) LOAD ZERO - set accumulator to zero
0x800b  # ADD INT1 - add first int
0x800c  # ADD INT2 - add second int
0x800d  # ADD INT3 - add third int
0x800e  # Add INT4 - add fourth int
0x200f  # (5) STORE RESULT - store result
0x0
0x0
0x0	# note some area is left between instructions and data
0x0	# just in case we want more instructions later.
0x0	# (0xA) ZERO: - the constant value zero
0x4	# (0xB) INT1:
0x8 	# (0xC) INT2:
0x10	# (0xD) INT3:
0x20	# (0xE) INT4: fourth int
0x0	# (0xF) RESULT:
