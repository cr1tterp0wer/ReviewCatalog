#
# this program subtracts four integers from zero.
# since subtraction is not commutative, we must
# do it the long way, storing the intermediate result
# each time. (Remember SUB NUM subtracts the contents
# of the accumulator from NUM and puts the result in the
# accumulator.)
#
# RESULT = 0
0x1010	# LOAD ZERO - set accumulator to zero
0x2015	# STORE RESULT 
# RESULT -= INT1
0x1011  # LOAD INT1 - load first int
0x9015  # SUB RESULT - subtract from result
0x2015  # (4) STORE RESULT - store in result
# and repeat the previous three instruction three more times
# RESULT -= INT2
0x1012  # load second int
0x9015  # subtract from result
0x2015  # store in result
# RESULT -= INT3
0x1013  # load third int
0x9015  # subtract from result
0x2015  # (0xA) store in result
# RESULT -= INT4
0x1014  # load fourth int
0x9015  # subtract from result
0x2015  # store in result
0x0	# (0xe) HALT
0x0	# (0xf) pad 
0x0	# (0x10) ZERO: 
0x4	# INT1: first int
0x8	# INT2: second int
0x10	# INT3: third int
0x20	# INT4: fourth int
0x0	# RESULT:
